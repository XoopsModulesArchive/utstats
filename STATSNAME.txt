Notes on stat name tracking in version 1.04 on:

If you wish to enable stat tracking by the stat name and password set in the 
player's global stats settings (under Network in the game menu), set 
"$usestatsname" to 1 in the config file (config.inc.php).  The one drawback to 
this is that the system will generate new entries for players with stats name 
and passwords set if their existing entry in the database does not have this 
info.  For small servers you can manually enter the information by looking up 
the entries in the log files before parsing them, but this would be very tedious 
for anything more, in which case you might just might consider starting fresh on 
your stats by dropping the database tables and recreating them.

The advantage in using the global stats name and password is that this won't 
cause a problem when someone else logs in with the same name as an existing 
player.  Also, a player can change their name and the stats database will 
reflect whatever name they last used in a game.

Currently there is no way to distinguish multiple players with the same name in 
the stats database, but this will be fixed in the next release.
