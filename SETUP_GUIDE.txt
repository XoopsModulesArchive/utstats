Easy Setup Guide for Windows systems (step-by-step)

This guide is intended as a step-by-step procedure for setting up a complete web 
server including SQL and PHP support on a Windows NT based system.  You may be 
able to get it to work on Windows 98, but it is not recommended.  I make no 
guarantees in following this document and probably cannot help you if you should 
have any trouble.  There is no guarantee that this will work for you on your 
particular setup and all is done at your own risk.  If you're running a server 
you should have some basic knowledge of Windows systems and Internet security.

===============================================================================
===== STEP 1: Apache Web Server ===============================================
===============================================================================

If you don't currently have a web server installed I recommend installing
Apache 2.0.  It's fast and stable.

Download and install Apache web server: http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

The latest  release as of this writing can be found here:
http://apache.webmeta.com/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.43-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi

Install by double-clicking the .msi file from Windows Explorer.  This requires 
the Microsoft MSI installer which is included in Windows 2000 and XP which you 
really should be running.  If you're running an older version of Windows and 
don't have it installed you can get it from:
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/instmsi.htm

Follow the prompts for installation.  If you don't have a domain name and will 
just be using IP addresses then it doesn't really matter what you enter and can 
just put "domain.com" or something for your network domain and server name.  You 
should run under the default port 80 unless there's a reason you need to use a 
different port.  Select "Typical" for the installation type - this will include 
the Apache documentation but not the module libraries, used for compiling 
additional libraries.  The server should start automatically.  Test your 
installation by going to the URL: http://localhost A screen should come up with 
the "Powered By Apache" logo at the bottom.  The server can be stopped or 
restarted from the Apache service tool in your taskbar by the clock.  Stop the 
web server for now by left-clicking the taskbar icon, selecting the "Apache2" 
server, then click "Stop".  Starting and stopping the Apache web server can also
be done from the icons added in the start menu.

Edit the Apache configuration file by going to the Apache server folder in your 
start menu, selecting "Configure Apache Server" and then "Edit the Apache httpd.conf Configuration File".
Scroll down to the section with all the "LoadModule" lines.  After the last one 
("#LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so") add the following lines:

LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache2.dll
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Find the following line:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var
  change to:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.php

Save the file and exit.

===============================================================================
===== STEP 2: MySQL ===========================================================
===============================================================================

Download and install MySQL: http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html

The latest release as of this writing can be found here:
http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/MySQL-3.23/mysql-3.23.54-win.zip

Unzip the archive to a temporary directory and run setup.  Follow the setup 
prompts and select "Typical" for installation type.  Once the installation is 
complete, copy the file "c:\mysql\my-medium.cnf" to "c:\my.cnf".  Install the 
MySQL server service by running (on WinNT/2K/XP):
c:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt.exe -install

Start the service by running:
net start MySql

Run the MySQL client:
c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe

Change your root user password (replace 'statspass' with a secure password):
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR root=PASSWORD('newpassword');

The semi-colon is necessary to end a chain of MySQL commands.

Create the database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE utstatsdb;

Create the user (replace 'statspass' with a secure password):
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,INDEX
    -> ON utstatsdb.*
    -> TO utstats@localhost
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'statspass';

Exit the MySQL client:
mysql> QUIT

===============================================================================
===== STEP 3: PHP =============================================================
===============================================================================

Download and install PHP: http://www.php.net

The latest version as of this writing is here:
http://www.php.net/get_download.php?df=php-4.3.0-Win32.zip

Extract the files to the root of your C: drive (a subdirectory is automatically 
created).  Rename the directory "php-4.3.0-Win32" to "php".  Copy the files 
from "c:\php\dlls\" to your Windows system directory:

c:\WINNT\System32 (Win2K/NT)
c:\Windows\System32 (WinXP)
c:\Windows\System (Win9x)

Copy php4ts.dll and php4ts.lib from "c:\php\" to your Windows system directory 
as above.

Copy c:\php\php.ini-recommended to your windows directory (c:\Windows or 
c:\WINNT) and rename to php.ini.  Edit php.ini and modify the following 
variables:

max_execution_time = 30
 change to:
max_execution_time = 60

error_reporting = E_ALL
  change to:
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

register_argc_argv = Off
  change to:
register_argc_argv = On

magic_quotes_gpc = Off
  change to:
magic_quotes_gpc = On

extension_dir = ./
  change to:
extension_dir = c:\php\extensions\

;extension=php_gd.dll
  change to:
extension=php_gd.dll

===============================================================================
===== STEP 4: UT2003 StatsDB ==================================================
===============================================================================

Start the Apache web browser.

Extract the latest UT2003 StatsDB program to your web server's document directory.
The default for Apache 2.0 would be "c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs".
You should now have a directory such as "c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs\utstatsdb-1.03".
Rename "utstatsdb-1.03" to "utstats".
Edit the file "statsdb.inc.php" in your utstats directory.
Change the $Adminpass variable from "adminpass" to something more secure.
Change the $SQLpw variable from "statspass" to whatever you set for the new
user you created in MySQL (not the MySQL root password).

You can optionally configure the variables in config.inc.php to your liking.
See the file or the README.txt file for more info.

Open a web brower and enter the following URL:
http://localhost/utstats/createtables.php?pass=adminpass

Replace "adminpass" with the password you setup in config.inc.php.  If all went 
well there won't be any errors.

To parse your log files into the database (the log files must be in your 
"utstats\Logs" directory or whatever you've changed this value to in 
config.inc.php) go to the following URL:

http://localhost/utstats/logs.php?pass=adminpass

You should now be able to access the stats via: http://localhost/utstats/

===============================================================================
===== Additional Notes ========================================================
===============================================================================

There are many configuration options available which I will not cover in this 
document.  This is just to help you get a web server up and running with MySQL 
and PHP in order to use UT2003 StatsDB.  You can easily change configuration 
options such as the root documents directory for your web pages or the log 
directory for your UT logs.  I've also not specifically covered security, but 
following these steps will give you a fairly secure web server.  However, you 
should still run some sort of firewall.  Speaking of firewalls, the only port 
you will need to have open or directed to your system is port 80 for the web 
server.  I hope this document helped some people since it was a tedious pain in 
the butt to write.
